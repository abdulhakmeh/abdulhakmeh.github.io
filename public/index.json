The task is to identify and sort possible outlier intervals from a multivariate time series weather dataset. We use a K-nearest neighbour based method to search for anomalous data points in the data. We then create intervals between the sampled points using the sliding window technique. An approximation to Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) is used to quantify the degree of di-vergence between two Gaussian distributions (the generated interval distribution and the distribution of the remaining data). At the end, a list of the top intervals is generated to rank the anomalies based on their scores. The results show that the algorithm is able to detect numerous outlier intervals. However, due to the lack of labeled data, we could not numerically evaluate the performance of the algorithm.\nDataset To evaluate the methodology, we conduct experiments with real-world multivariate time series data recorded from ocean observing buoys provided by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). The dataset covers six months of hourly data, beginning in June 2012 and ending in November of the same year. This period corresponds to the Atlantic hurricane season, which was particularly active this year with 19 tropical cyclones. 10 of them became hurricanes (winds over 64 km/h). This information can help to interpret and evaluate the results by matching the extracted interval with the already known time window of hurricanes since the dataset does not provide ground-truth data. Due to the limited time, we skip the matching. The variables provided are measurements of significant wave height Hs, wind speed W, and sea level pressure P. The data were collected at a site near the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean 1 (23.866¬∞ N, 68.481¬∞ W).\nResults The above figure illustrates the results of applying the KL al- gorithm based on generated intervals containing pointwise outliers. The figure shows three time series curves represent- ing the features of the data set. The red color highlights the area where the outlier intervals are detected. The numbers at the top indicate the order of the intervals based on their intensity. Number 1 has the highest intensity. The results show that the algorithm is able to detect numerous outlier intervals, most of which could be identified by eye. Others, like interval number 4 are hard to identify directly. However, we could not confirm the results due to the lack of labeled data.\nFor the detailed information about the utilized methods, please refer to my GitHub repository to view the source code or to the attached report file.\n","date":1664236800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664236800,"objectID":"7b259cb3f8d340004c3f22584aa485d6","permalink":"https://abdulhakmeh.github.io/project/outlier_detection/","publishdate":"2022-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/outlier_detection/","section":"project","summary":"PhD.

State-of-the-art NILM methods based on neural networks showed remarkable disaggregation accuracy results. Internally, the network input data are sampled based on a windowing technique with a fixed window length limiting the number of input data, affecting the disaggregation performance. In addition, the use of different window length configurations per device increases the complexity of the model.\nIn this project, a windowing method is proposed using nonlinear algebraic functions to capture the input data points. The goal is to investigate the effect of expanding the time interval of the input window on load disaggregation without influencing the model complexity. Non-equidistant temporal sampling technique splits the traditional window into two sequences according to a fraction: a high-resolution sequence and an non-equally spaced sequence generated by means of non-linear algebraic functions, allowing the input window to contain more historical information without having to adjust the window length parameter. For evaluating the proposed technique, different variants of non-equidistant temporal sampling are suggested, the inverse and the linear downsampling function. The inverse generates an entirely non-equally spaced window, and the linear function creates a fraction of the window with equally time-spaced samples. Both functions cover the same effective window length as the proposed method.\nThe results confirm a positive impact of aggregating the historical information on load disaggregation. The promising potential of the proposed technique shown during the evaluation can make a step forward in the NILM field, as collecting historical input data according to a non-equidistant or linear manner ensure an improvement in the performance without affecting the model complexity.\n","date":1646752402,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646752402,"objectID":"40ea08b88d6a2dd21929e85349e37c48","permalink":"https://abdulhakmeh.github.io/project/non-linear-windowing/","publishdate":"2022-03-08T17:13:22+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/non-linear-windowing/","section":"project","summary":"Non Linear Windowing for NILM","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Investigating the effects of non-uniform input data windowing on electrical load disaggregation performance","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The motivation relies on the fact that the fuel costs are held accountable for the third of the total operational costs of those services, besides being the Heavy-duty vehicles one of the carbon emissions sources.\nIn this study, we examine the important but complex problem of assigning optimal routes to a set of vehicles, where many platooning potentials can be offered. We use the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic approach to solve the centralized routing problem with realistic assumptions on a real-world map. A robust design method is used to tune the model parameters. Unlike the previous contributions, a restriction on the platoon size is proposed to avoid traffic congestion. For a fair evaluation, a mathematical optimization solver using Gurobi is implemented based on a mathematical formulation of the problem. An additional sensitivity analysis is made to study the impact of different model parameters on the output.\nIn practice applying simulated annealing achieved approximately 5% fuel saving with an instance that has 500 trucks. For evaluating the algorithm on a real-live map the algorithm scored near 4.5% of fuel saving. The findings confirmed a satisfactory performance of the approach over the exact solver even when the restriction of the platoon size is applied, which can have a positive influence at the forefront of the platooning field, as solving the problem and enhance the solution in a reasonable time can ensure a globally optimized fuel cost-saving for the participants besides bringing environmental benefits.\n","date":1586431456,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586431456,"objectID":"f2efd7e1647551ad336e60def1220f32","permalink":"https://abdulhakmeh.github.io/project/simulated-annealing-for-platooning/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T13:24:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/simulated-annealing-for-platooning/","section":"project","summary":"Simulated Annealing for Platooning","tags":["Metaheuristics"],"title":"Optimization fuel-consuming in platooning of vehicles by using sophisticated meta-heuristics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Abdul Hakmeh"],"categories":[],"content":"Abstract Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is one of the practical applications of the smart electricity grid. NILM provides a comprehensive road-map to detect and determine operation circumstances of an individual appliance from an aggregate load. It can also provide the energy management system with information about appliance-level power consumption, analytical statistics, and detection of energy-hungry appliances to ensure the efficient use of the resources. The event detection is one of the NILM phases that is responsible for detecting state-changes of the appliances.\nIn this project, a study is made to measure the impact of data sampling rate on the detection accuracy obtained through an event detection algorithm. Therefore, a machine learning based shapelet approach for electrical appliance use detection is implemented. The fast shapelet approach detects the occurrence of an event that is caused by switching on/off of an electrical appliance. A general architecture is introduced to evaluate the performance through feeding the algorithm with re-sampled data and comparing the obtained accuracy with the sampling rate. Different metrics are used to ensure a comprehensive evaluation; F1-score, confusion matrix, and classification accuracy.\nData set To evaluate our algorithm the BLUED dataset is used. The BLUED includes one week of the current and the voltage measurements for a family house in Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh. The data collection were taken in October 2011 from nearly 50 electrical devices in the house. The dataset presents the changes in the operating status of each appliance (turn on/off). The measurements were taken by using two separate systems; one is at the main distribution panel to capture the current and voltage, and the other system is used to register the time stamps for each event. The reason behind choosing the BLUED is that this dataset in its original form provides raw data of the current and the voltage.\nResults The results of the experiment have shown that it is possible to detect appliances events with downsampled data using a shapelet based approach. Furthermore, it would have been as well possible that the downsampling improves the accuracy, but the evaluation of the event detection on noisy downsampled data have statistically verified that the lowering of the sampling rate is directly proportional to the accuracy of the detection in a linear form.\n","date":1565264355,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565264355,"objectID":"748dca3c7c7f54b93ee7315a746eeb93","permalink":"https://abdulhakmeh.github.io/project/shapelet-based-event-detection/","publishdate":"2019-08-08T13:39:15+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/shapelet-based-event-detection/","section":"project","summary":"Abstract Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is one of the practical applications of the smart electricity grid.
